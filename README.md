I whipped this up in a day, there's obviously a lot of room for improvement, but I'm only one guy. I figured I could use this, so why not make it available.

This main branch includes the Google Chrome extension, but there are also branches for Firefox and Opera as well (they needed different manifest files hence the different versions). 

The crx files are the packed versions of the extension and are the versions of the extension submitted to the stores for approval.
